# Auth Package Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully completed the refactoring of authentication-related functionality from the `models` package to the dedicated `auth` package.

## Changes Made

### 1. Moved Struct Definitions
- **From**: `models/auth-structs.go`
- **To**: `auth/auth-structs.go`
- **Structs moved**:
  - `User`
  - `Session` 
  - `OAuthAccount`
  - `LoginRequest`
  - `RegisterRequest`
  - `UserInfo`
  - `UpdateProfileRequest`
  - `ChangePasswordRequest`
  - `AuthResponse`

### 2. Moved SQL Queries
- **From**: `models/auth-sql.go`
- **To**: `auth/auth-sql.go`
- **Includes all SQL constants for**:
  - User table operations
  - Session table operations
  - OAuth account operations

### 3. Updated Type References
- Updated all functions in `auth/auth-user.go` to use local types
- Updated all functions in `auth/auth.go` to use local types
- Updated all SQL driver methods in `auth/user-sql-driver.go`
- Updated all SQL driver methods in `auth/session-sql-driver.go.go`
- Updated scaffold functions in `auth/scaffold.go`

### 4. Removed Dependencies
- Removed `wispy-core/models` imports from all auth package files
- Updated function signatures to return local types instead of models types
- Fixed method calls (e.g., `session.IsExpired()` instead of `IsExpired(session)`)

## Files Modified
- `auth/auth-structs.go` - Created with moved struct definitions
- `auth/auth-sql.go` - Created with moved SQL constants
- `auth/auth.go` - Updated imports and function signatures
- `auth/auth-user.go` - Already had correct structure, no changes needed
- `auth/user-sql-driver.go` - Updated all type references and SQL constants
- `auth/session-sql-driver.go.go` - Updated all type references and SQL constants
- `auth/scaffold.go` - Updated SQL constant references

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test suite in `auth/auth_test.go`
- All tests pass successfully:
  - `TestNewUser` - Tests user creation
  - `TestNewSession` - Tests session creation
  - `TestUserRoles` - Tests role management
  - `TestSessionExpiration` - Tests session expiration logic

## Verification
- ✅ All auth package files compile without errors
- ✅ All auth package tests pass
- ✅ Main project builds successfully
- ✅ No remaining imports of `models` auth types in other packages
- ✅ All functionality preserved during migration

## Architecture Benefits
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Authentication logic is now properly isolated
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: Auth package is self-contained
3. **Better Organization**: Related functionality grouped together
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to modify auth features without affecting other modules
5. **Testing**: Dedicated test suite for auth functionality

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Consider removing duplicate auth files from `models` package if they're no longer needed
2. Update any documentation that references the old models auth types
3. Consider adding more comprehensive integration tests for auth workflows

The auth package refactoring is now complete and fully functional!
