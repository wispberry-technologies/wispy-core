# Template Engine Error Handling - Implementation Summary

## Issue Fixed
The template engine now has robust error handling that ensures unresolved variables and failed blocks don't prevent the rest of the template from rendering.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Unresolved Variables Render as Empty (No Errors)
- **Before**: Unresolved variables like `{{ missing.variable }}` would generate errors
- **After**: They render as empty strings and continue processing
- **Implementation**: `ResolveFilterChain` returns `nil, nil, nil` (value, type, errors) for unresolved variables

### 2. Block Tag Failures Are Logged But Rendering Continues
- **Before**: Failed blocks would stop template processing
- **After**: Errors are appended to the error list but rendering continues
- **Key Changes**:
  - `processVariable`: Errors are collected but processing continues
  - `processTemplateTag`: Errors are collected but processing continues  
  - `IfTemplate`: Unresolved conditions are treated as false (no error)
  - `ForTag`: Unresolved collections are skipped gracefully (no error)

### 3. Main Rendering Loop Is Error-Resilient
- The main `Render` loop in `template.go` always continues processing even when individual components fail
- Errors are accumulated in a slice and returned at the end
- Position tracking ensures the parser doesn't get stuck on malformed content

## Error Categories

### Silent (No Errors Generated)
1. **Unresolved variables**: `{{ missing.field }}` → renders empty
2. **Unresolved if conditions**: `{% if missing.field %}` → treated as false
3. **Unresolved for collections**: `{% for item in missing.list %}` → loop skipped

### Logged (Errors Generated but Rendering Continues)
1. **Unknown filters**: `{{ name | bad_filter }}` → renders empty, logs error
2. **Unknown template tags**: `{% unknown_tag %}` → skipped, logs error
3. **Invalid collection types in for loops**: `{% for item in "string" %}` → skipped, logs error
4. **Malformed tags**: `{% if %}` → skipped, logs error

## Test Coverage
- ✅ `TestTemplateEngine_ErrorResilience` - Comprehensive error handling tests
- ✅ `TestTemplateEngine_HomePageWithCustomData` - Real-world template with unresolved variables
- ✅ All existing template engine tests continue to pass

## Demonstration
The implementation was verified with a comprehensive test that shows:
- Unresolved variables render as empty
- Unknown filters generate errors but rendering continues
- Unresolved conditions default to false
- Unknown template tags are skipped
- Valid content renders correctly despite errors

## Files Modified
- `/core/template.go` - Main rendering loop error handling
- `/core/template_function_utils.go` - Variable resolution error handling  
- `/core/template_functions.go` - IfTemplate and ForTag error handling
- `/core/template_test.go` - Added comprehensive error resilience tests
- `/sites/localhost/pages/home.html` - Added test variables for integration testing

## Result
The template engine is now production-ready with graceful error handling that prioritizes user experience - templates render successfully even when some data is missing or invalid, while still providing detailed error information for developers.
